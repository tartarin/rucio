Traceability and logging
------------------------

Rucio will log the the source of all actions (ip, host, etc) and the person who initiated them. The aim is to be able to answer the basic questions who, what, where, and when concerning any action. This requires retaining all relevant information, including timestamps and the credentials ID of the user.
